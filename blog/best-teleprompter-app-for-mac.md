# Best Teleprompter App for Mac in 2026: An Honest Look

The best teleprompter app for Mac is the one whose text **reliably follows your voice** and stays **invisible when you share your screen** - and surprisingly few do both. After testing most of the options on (and off) the App Store, the app I build and use is [VoicePrompter for Mac](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6758573080?pt=128503212&ct=blog-best-mac&mt=8). Below is the honest comparison, including where the other apps are genuinely good.

**Full disclosure:** I'm the developer of VoicePrompter, so I'm biased - but I've tried to make this fair. I'll tell you which rivals are solid and what they do better, and I'll be specific about the one thing most of them get wrong.

## What actually matters in a Mac teleprompter

Before comparing anything, here's what genuinely matters for a Mac workflow:

- **It stays on top - including over full-screen apps.** On top of Keynote in presentation mode, on top of full-screen Zoom. If it vanishes when you go full-screen, it's useless for the most common recording setups.
- **It's invisible to screen recording and screen sharing.** If your prompter shows up in a demo, webinar, or screen share, that's a hard fail. The point is that it's for you, not your viewers.
- **Voice scrolling that actually works** - text that tracks your speech, pauses when you pause, resumes when you speak. This is much harder to get right than it sounds (more on that next).
- **Real language support**, not a dropdown where only English performs.
- **Fast and simple to start**, and customizable enough to fit how you actually work.

## "Voice-activated" doesn't mean what you think

This is the single most important thing to understand before you choose, because the marketing is genuinely misleading. Two completely different technologies are both sold as "voice":

- **Sound detection ("voice sync").** The app listens for *sound above a volume threshold*. You talk, it scrolls; you pause, it stops. It has **no idea what you're saying or where you are** in the script. One Mac teleprompter spells this out on its own blog: *"voice sync, not voice recognition… simply detecting audio levels."* The catch - the moment you go off-script, skip a paragraph, ad-lib, or jump back, it falls apart. It's just reacting to noise.
- **Word tracking (real speech recognition).** The app follows your *actual words* and your *position* in the script. You can skip ahead, improvise, or go back to re-read a line and it keeps pace. This is much harder to build - and it's what you actually want.

VoicePrompter does **both**: a simple **Sound mode** (the thing other apps call "voice-activated") *and* true **word tracking** that follows your speech in 60+ languages - and lets you scroll **backward** just by starting an earlier line. The word-tracking engine is the part I spent the most time on; it's why one reviewer wrote that it *"follows them word for word."* I go deeper on the why in [why all teleprompter apps suck](./why-all-teleprompter-apps-suck.md).

## The comparison at a glance

| App | Voice scrolling | Works across languages | Invisible on screen share | From the App Store |
|-----|-----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| **VoicePrompter** | **Word tracking + Sound mode** | **Yes - 60+ languages** | **Yes** | **Yes** |
| Teleprompter.com | Word tracking | Partial | No | Yes / web |
| PromptSmart | Word tracking | English-focused | No | Yes (iOS port on Mac) |
| Notchie | Sound only | n/a (sound) | Native app | Yes |
| Textream | Word tracking (unreliable) | No (CJK reported broken) | Native app | No - GitHub download |
| BIGVU / Speakflow | Suite / web tool | Varies | No | Web / cross-platform |

## The apps, honestly

### VoicePrompter for Mac (the one I built)

A native macOS menu-bar app with a transparent overlay that stays on top of everything - including full-screen Keynote and Zoom - and is **completely invisible** in Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, OBS, and QuickTime recordings. It uses Apple's on-device speech recognition (private, works offline), supports **60+ languages** with auto-detection, and offers both **word tracking and Sound mode**, plus **backward scrolling**. You can start a script in **one click from your clipboard**, set up menu-bar quick settings, and customize the look in detail. It's 2 MB and launches instantly. There's also a free web version, and it's used by creators in **125+ countries**.

What users say: *"the most robust, reliable, versatile and customizable one I've tried… follows them word for word"*; on sales calls, *"they stay visible only to me even when I share my screen."*

### Teleprompter.com

Real voice scrolling and a polished, recording-focused product with cross-device sync. If your workflow is "record me talking to camera," it's a legitimate choice. Where it falls short for Mac pros: it isn't a transparent overlay that stays invisible during a screen share, and it isn't built around a floating, always-on-top Mac window.

### PromptSmart

The original voice-tracking teleprompter (its "VoiceTrack" feature) - the voice tech is real and works well in English. Two honest drawbacks as of mid-2026: recognition falls off noticeably outside English, and the Mac app feels like a port of the iPhone app rather than a native Mac tool, with a dated, clunky interface next to a built-for-macOS app. If English-only voice tracking is all you need, it's capable.

### Notchie

A Mac-native notch teleprompter. The key thing to know: by the company's **own description**, its "voice-activated" scrolling is **sound detection, not word tracking** - it scrolls on audio level, not on your words. That's the same as VoicePrompter's basic Sound mode, which means it can't follow you when you go off-script. If you only ever read top-to-bottom in a quiet room, it's fine; if you ad-lib or jump around, you'll feel the difference.

### Textream

Free and open source, which is genuinely nice. Two honest caveats. First, you install it from **GitHub, not the App Store** - so there's no App Store safety check, and the setup is a real barrier for non-technical users who can't vet the code themselves. Second, reliability: as of mid-2026 its public issue tracker reports voice tracking freezing periodically, "doesn't scroll with my speech," tracking breaking when you resize the window, and voice **broken for Chinese/Japanese/Korean**. For a teleprompter, reliability is everything - if it stumbles mid-take, it's worse than no teleprompter. (For contrast, a VoicePrompter user emailed after using it for a *Chinese* broadcast: *"it worked well."*)

### BIGVU, Speakflow and other web/suite tools

These are broader creator suites (BIGVU) or browser-based prompters (Speakflow) rather than native Mac teleprompters. They can be useful for an all-in-one captions-and-editing workflow or a quick web prompter, but they aren't a native, always-on-top, invisible-on-screen-share Mac overlay - which is exactly what Mac demos, webinars, and calls need.

## So which should you use?

- **Demos, webinars, tutorials, online presentations, podcasts, or sales calls on a Mac** → [VoicePrompter for Mac](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6758573080?pt=128503212&ct=blog-best-mac&mt=8). The combination of an invisible, always-on-top overlay with *reliable* voice scrolling is the specific set of features that solves the real problem.
- **Camera-only filming and you want free** → the [VoicePrompter web app](https://voiceprompter.app) is excellent and costs nothing (it just can't do the native always-on-top / invisible-overlay tricks).
- **English-only voice tracking with device sync** → PromptSmart or Teleprompter.com are worth a look.

## Why the invisible overlay matters more than you'd think

Picture a sales call over Zoom. You have a tight script - opening, qualifying questions, demo flow, close. With a normal teleprompter window you have two problems: if you share your screen, the text appears in the share; and even if you don't, the window clutters your screen and you're one accidental app-switch from losing it.

With an invisible overlay that stays on top, the prompter is always there, always readable, visible only to you, and never in the recording or share. That's a qualitatively different experience - and it's why so many VoicePrompter reviews mention calls and demos specifically. I cover the full setup in [how to use a teleprompter on Zoom](./how-to-use-teleprompter-on-zoom.md).

## Frequently asked questions

**What's the difference between sound scrolling and voice scrolling?** Sound scrolling moves the text whenever it hears you talking (it's reacting to *noise*). Real voice scrolling - word tracking - follows your actual words and position, so you can skip, ad-lib, or scroll back and it keeps up. VoicePrompter offers both.

**Do any Mac teleprompters stay invisible during screen sharing?** Very few. VoicePrompter is built around a transparent overlay that's hidden from Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, OBS, and QuickTime recordings - most other apps appear in the share.

**Is there a free teleprompter for Mac?** Yes - the [VoicePrompter web app](https://voiceprompter.app) is free and runs in any browser (or installs as an app). It does voice scrolling and mirror mode; the native Mac app adds always-on-top and the invisible overlay.

**Which teleprompter follows your voice in other languages?** VoicePrompter handles 60+ languages with on-device recognition. Some apps are English-strong but weaker elsewhere, and at least one open-source option currently has voice tracking broken for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.

**Can a teleprompter scroll backward?** Most can't - they're forward-only. VoicePrompter scrolls back to an earlier line as soon as you start reading it, which is handy for retakes.
